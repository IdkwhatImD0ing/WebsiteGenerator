## The Problem ❗

While the internet is a pivotal part of business representation today, the technical barrier to creating and maintaining a website is still significant for many. Small businesses, freelancers, and non-profits often lack the resources to craft a professional online presence.

## Project Goals 📋

WebWeaver democratizes the website creation process by providing:

- An interactive AI chatbot to quickly outline website requirements and generate a draft.
- Collaborative tools for refining the website with the AI, incorporating user feedback in real-time.
- Advanced code editing interfaces for users with web development experience.
- A streamlined, user-friendly dashboard for managing the entire website creation process.

## Technologies 🖥️

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building user interfaces, chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities.
- **Material UI**: A React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design, used for crafting a sleek, intuitive user interface.
- **Redis**: An easy to use in-memory data structure store, used for storing and synchronizing state across clients.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js, used for making requests to our backend services.
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints, used for our backend services.
- **GPT-Vision**: A multimodal large language model for vision-and-language tasks, used for generating website drafts.

## What We Learned 🧠

Throughout the development of WebWeaver, our team has gained invaluable insights into:

- Integrating AI with web development to streamline the design process.
- The complexities of real-time collaborative editing and the technical solutions to synchronize state across clients.
- The importance of user experience design in making complex processes like web development accessible to non-technical users.
- Best practices in modern web development, including component-based architecture and state management with Redux.

## Next Steps ✍️

Moving forward, we plan to:

- Implement additional frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue for more customization.
- Introduce a feature for AI-powered optimization suggestions to improve website performance and SEO.
- Develop a mobile app version of WebWeaver for on-the-go website management and editing.
- Expand our user support with tutorials, guides, and a community forum.
