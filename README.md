## The Problem ❗
In today's world, the internet is so integrated into our lives that it is necessary for every business to have a website to represent themselves. However, not everyone has the means to create an entire website.

## Project Goals 📋
Our project aims to make this process intuitive and tailored to each user. This includes features such as:
- Interactive chatbot in which users can outline their requirements and receive an initial website within seconds
- The ability to work together with our chatbot to revise the website to one's preferances, as well as experiment with different features
- The option to directly edit generated code for more experienced users
- User-friendly interface that allows for doing all this in one organized page
